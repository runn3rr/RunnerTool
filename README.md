# Runner Tool
Runner Tool is a simple, lightweight, and open-source tool designed specifically for use with Discord. It offers an easy-to-use interface and efficient performance, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced users. The tool is built with a focus on minimalism, ensuring that it doesnâ€™t overwhelm users with unnecessary features while still providing everything needed for basic Discord management and interaction. However, it's important to note that users should approach the tool with respect and responsibility. For the love of God, stop skidding! Abusing or misusing tools like these only harms the community and goes against the spirit of open-source software.
